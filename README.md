### Fizz Buzz Challenge

#### What I did 
* I used Gemfile and rspec for testing, coding in vsc. 

#### What I learned 
* Testing my code and make it handle different user inputs.


#### How to use this piece of software
    First you need to fork and clone this repo.
    Load it in irb.
    To get an output between 1-100 use this 
   `for loop: 100.times {|n| output << fizz_buzz(n+1)}`
 
    
    Happy coding!
